Specifications
==============
Addresses
An ndau address is a string of 48 letters and numbers, and is generated according to a specified algorithm from a securely-generated public/private keypair known as its ownership key. ndau addresses are designed to be trivially recognizable as ndau addresses and to be easily checked for valid format. To avoid confusion, ndau addresses are all lowercase, contain no accented characters, and do not contain the characters O, o, 0, L, l, or 1. A checksum character is included to reduce the risk of typographic errors in the specification of an address.

Address Types
User (normal) Address - code 'A'
This is an address for normal holding and transfer of ndau. It has no special properties.

ndau operations address - code 'N'
All addresses owned and operated by ndev (for node operations, etc.) will use an N code.

Endowment address - code 'E'
Addresses generated by and for the endowment (sales of ndau) will use the E code.

Exchange address - code 'X'
Addresses designated for use by exchanges (and with special rules for EAI) will use an X code.

Accounts
An account is a single repository of value on the ndau blockchain. An ndau holder may have many ndau accounts, managed together in an ndau wallet application.
An account has a single balance and a single address that never changes. All ndau held in an account are indistinguishable: no transaction can specify which ndau in an account are to be affected by it, as there is no reason to do so. Unlike other digital currencies, ndau accounts have additional attributes other than their balances, so the words ‘account’ and ‘address’ are not synonyms. Every account has exactly one address, and every address is associated with exactly one account.
An account is created when a new valid ndau address is specified as the target of a transfer transaction or as the recipient of ndau newly released from the Endowment. Accounts are always identified by their addresses in ndau transactions. 
Any number of transfers may be made into a newly-created account. No transfers may be made out of that account, nor any other operations performed on it, until a valid set of signing keys has been assigned to it. Those signing keys (and any optional rules governing their use) control all further transactions on the account. No transaction may occur unless it is properly signed with one or more of the currently-valid keys assigned to the account.

Transaction Fees
Every transaction is charged a transaction fee, paid by the sender in addition to the amount being transferred. Transaction fees are calculated based on published rates. An address must have a sufficient balance to pay for the transfer fee and the amount being transferred. Accrued but uncredited EAI is not available for the transaction, nor are any incoming transfers whose settlement periods have not expired.

Stabilization Incentive Burn
Wicked complicated stuff goes here.

Ecosystem Alignment Incentive
An Ecosystem Alignment Incentive (EAI) is provided to encourage ndau holders to maintain their accounts over time and to encourage them to participate in the support of the entire ndau ecosystem. EAI comprises newly-created ndau (not released from the Endowment) that may be credited to a holder’s account in exchange for the holder’s ecosystem activities.
The ndau consensus network is built on a set of reliable, high-performance, censorship-resistant validator nodes. ndau holders help identify such nodes by observing their histories and selecting those to which they delegate their ndau accounts. Accounts retain their balances but do not accrue EAI until they have been delegated to a node, and that node is exclusively responsible for crediting that accrued EAI to its delegated accounts. Should a node fail to make those credits in a timely fashion, the holder will lose that accrued EAI and it may not be reclaimed. This potential penalty encourages the holder to study the set of available nodes, select high-quality ones, and monitor their ongoing performance. There are system-wide limits set on the frequency and amount of EAI credits: a minimum amount must accrue before it is credited, and credits may not be issued too frequently. Additional limits and requirements may be placed on EAI credit transactions by the BPC. Should its delegated node fail to provide satisfactory performance, an ndau account may be redelegated to a different node at any time.
EAI is accrued based on the weighted average age (WAA) of the balance in an account. Each time an account is the target of a transfer transaction, its weighted average age is updated:
current WAA=WAA at last inbound transfer+elapsed time

new WAA=  (current WAA ∙ current balance)/(current balance+transferred amount)

Outgoing transfers do not affect the WAA of the source account, nor do any EAI credit transactions. EAI is accrued according to a rate schedule published by the BPC, and the rate at which EAI is accrued by an account is based on its WAA.
An account’s EAI may optionally be credited to a different account. That target account may be accruing EAI at a different rate than the source account or have other properties that make it a preferred destination for EAI. An account’s EAI may not be sent to an account that is itself already sending its EAI to a different account.

Locking
To encourage long-term stability, ndau accounts may also accrue an EAI incentive if they are locked by the holder to prohibit withdrawals for a specified notice period. A locked account earns a lock incentive based on the notice period specified: longer periods provide larger lock incentives: the lock incentive rate schedule is published by the BPC. The current maximum lock incentive is obtained when an account is locked with a three-year notice period.
When an account is locked, the holder specifies a notice period and, optionally, a second account address to which its accrued EAI is to be credited. This alternate address may be unlocked, allowing credited EAI to be transferred while the original account balance remains locked. [[[ EAI may not be c
While transfers in to a locked account are permitted, no ndau may be transferred out of it. When the holder intends to unlock an account, they give notice of that intent. The account’s specified notice period begins, and no further incoming transfers are permitted although accrued EAI is still credited to it. When the notice period expires the account is unlocked, and outgoing transfers are again permitted.
When an account is locked, its WAA is immediately increased by the length of the unlock notice period. Its WAA continues to be updated at each incoming transfer until notice is given that the holder wishes to unlock the account. Its WAA is then frozen until the notice period ends, at which time the account is unlocked and its WAA resumes increasing.
A locked account may be relocked at any time, and the account to which its accrued EAI is credited may optionally be changed when it is relocked. If no unlock notice has yet been given, the new notice period must be longer than the current notice period. The account’s WAA is immediately reduced by the length of the current lock period and increased by the length of the new notice period. If unlock notice has been given, the new notice period must be longer than the time remaining before the current notice period ends. Its WAA is reduced by the remaining length of the current notice period and increased by the length of the new notice period. Relocking an account cancels any current unlock notice: the account will not be unlocked until the holder gives notice again and the new notice period expires.

Settlement Period
The ndau settlement period discourages the use of ndau for fraud or ransomware and can support a future dispute resolution mechanism for unauthorized transfers. This settlement period may be especially valuable to exchanges, as they are both likely targets for fraudulent outgoing transfers and likely to detect them within a short settlement period.
Transfer transactions are subject to the source account’s settlement period, during which time the transfer amount is not available to either the source or the target account. When an ndau account is created its settlement period is set to a default specified by the BPC. All newly-created accounts have a default settlement period specified by the BPC. An account holder may change an account’s settlement period to any value from 0 up to a BPC-defined limit, but the current settlement period must elapse before such a change takes effect.
Transfer transactions are immediately added to the target account’s balance. That account’s weighted average age is updated, and it continues to accrue EAI based on that new balance and weighted average age and have that EAI credited. The transferred amount, however, is added to the target account’s list of unsettled transfers. The total amount of an account’s unsettled transfers at any time is unavailable and may not be transferred out from it. Whenever a transfer transaction is initiated from an account the list of unsettled transfers is first checked and any transfers due to settle are removed from it and the total updated, increasing the account’s transferrable balance.
EAI accrues on a transfer during the settlement period at the rate that would have been effective if the amount had already been received in the target account, and it is credited to the target account under the same rules as settled transfers.

Validation Scripts
ndau accounts are protected by security mechanisms more powerful and more flexible than those offered by other digital currencies. Account transactions may be required to meet multiple criteria before being accepted as valid, such as having multiple signatures, minimum or maximum amounts, or a minimum time since the last transaction. Each ndau account must have at least one validation key associated with it, and it may also have a validation script assigned. Those keys and validation script are used to validate any subsequent transactions submitted for that account.
An ndau account has an address that is generated from a key known as the ownership key. A newly-created account can be the target of transfer transactions from other sources (including EAI) and can receive ndau newly released from the Endowment. No validation keys are associated with it and no other transactions are valid until a Set Validation Script and Keys transaction is submitted for the account. That transaction assigns one or more validation keys and an optional validation script to it. Once those keys and script are assigned, all subsequent transactions are checked against them and are only valid if authorized by them. Validation keys may be changed later, but at least one validation key must thereafter always remain associated with the account.
The first Set Validation Script and Keys transaction for an account must be signed with that account’s ownership key. All subsequent transactions must be signed with one or more of the validation keys currently assigned to the account and must be authorized as valid by the current validation script if one is present. If there is no validation script assigned, then the transaction’s signatures alone are sufficient to validate it. If a validation script is present, the transaction signatures only indicate that the transaction was properly formatted and was submitted by at least one valid signer. Only then will the validation script be run. The validation script then determines the validity of the transaction: the transaction signatures alone may not be sufficient.
Each validation script indicates the minimum number of keys it requires. For example, a script implementing two-of-three key validation will require three keys be specified for it in a Set Validation Script and Keys transaction. Either the set of keys or the validation script may be omitted from that transaction. If no keys are specified, the current set of keys remains unchanged. If no validation script is specified, the current validation script remains unchanged: to remove a validation script if one has been assigned it must be replaced with a trivial script that permits all transactions signed with one of the current set of keys.
The validation script is checked for proper formatting and syntax when it is being set, and the Set Validation Script and Keys transaction is not valid if the script contains syntax errors. Validation scripts have access to the current transaction, account state, and system variables but may not modify them. They may not generate new transactions or trigger external events of any sort: they perform no function other than to determine the validity of a transaction submitted for an account.
A validation script returns the value valid to indicate that a transaction has passed its validation tests. Any other return value, or any runtime error in the script, will cause the transaction to be invalid.
Since all system variables and properties of the account and transaction are available to the script, scripts may establish validation rules for specific transaction types or based on specific values in the transaction or account. Validation rules may be imposed on the Set Validation Script and Keys transaction itself: such rules could require two of three signatures to change the account’s validation keys, or they could make an account’s script immutable by preventing any future Set Validation Script and Keys transactions from changing it.

NDAU CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS

Version 1.1
June 9, 2019
NDAU – A BUOYANT DIGITAL CURRENCY
ndau is a digital currency uniquely designed to serve as a long-term store of value. In addition to the features available in traditional digital currencies, ndau supports sophisticated monetary policy and governance mechanisms. This functional specification describes the user-visible features of ndau and serves as an introduction to other materials. Extensive material about ndau can be found at the ndau Collective Knowledge Base: https://ndaucollective.org/knowledge-base
ADDRESS AND ACCOUNT CREATION
ACCOUNTS
An account is a single repository of value on the ndau blockchain. An ndau holder may have many ndau accounts, managed together in an ndau wallet application.
An account has a single address that never changes. All ndau held in an account are indistinguishable: no transaction can specify which ndau in an account are to be affected by it, as there is no reason to do so. Unlike other digital currencies, ndau accounts have additional attributes other than their balances, so the words ‘account’ and ‘address’ are not synonyms but are sometimes used interchangeably. Every account has exactly one address, and every address is associated with exactly one account.
ACCOUNT CREATION
ndau accounts are always referred to by their addresses. Accounts have other attributes, and an account's address never changes. An account is created by the generation of a new ndau address and then by an ndau transaction that refers to that address. The address must first be used in a transaction that transfers ndau to it: this may be a transfer of ndau from another address, the release of newly-issued ndau to it, or the receipt of EAI (see below) directed to that address by another account. Any number of transfers may be made into a newly-created account before any other action is taken on it.
Before any other actions can be taken validation rules must be set for it. Validation rules provide sophisticated control over an account's transactions. They specify signature and other requirements that must be met if a transaction is to be valid.
An ndau address is created from a public/private keypair known as the account's ownership key. Possession of that key proves ownership of the address and can be used to establish its validation rules.
The transaction to set an account’s validation rules must be signed with the address' ownership key. After the account is claimed that key is never used again. All further transactions must be signed with the private keys associated with the public keys provided in the account's validation rules.
ADDRESSES
An ndau address is a string of 48 letters and numbers generated according to a cryptographic algorithm from an ownership public key. ndau addresses are designed to be trivially recognizable as ndau addresses and to be easily checked for valid format. To avoid confusion, ndau addresses are all lowercase, contain no accented characters, and do not contain the characters O, o, 0, L, l, or 1. A checksum character is included to reduce the risk of typographic errors in the specification of an address. An ndau address is a byte32 encoding, using a custom alphabet, of a portion of the SHA256 hash of the ownership public key, concatenated with additional marker and checksum information. The result is a 48-character address that always begins with the distinctive 2-letter prefix nd followed by one character that specifies the type of address. The address ends with a checksum so it can be trivially inspected for typos or transpositions.
ADDRESS TYPES
Each address type has different attributes and may be handled differently in some transactions. In some cases the designation is for ease of identification, but any account type with distinctive properties will have valid addresses whitelisted to prevent fraudulent use.
The ndau account types are:
USER ADDRESS - TYPE 'NDA'
This is an address for normal holding and transfer of ndau. It has no special attributes.
NDAU NETWORK OPERATIONS ADDRESS - TYPE 'NDN'
These addresses identify accounts used by ndau engineering and operations. They behave the same as other user addresses but are distinguished for convenience.
NDAU ENDOWMENT ADDRESS - TYPE 'NDE'
Addresses used by the Endowment for the release of new ndau to be issued directly to a purchaser by a sale at the Target Price or to an exchange. A single canonical address is used by the Endowment for releasing new ndau. 
EXCHANGE ADDRESS - TYPE 'NDX'
Addresses designated for use by cryptocurrency exchanges. Authorized exchanges will be whitelisted and only exchange addresses on that list are subject to exchange-address rules. Exchange addresses always earn a fixed 2% EAI (if they are delegated), may not be locked, and transfers from them are not subject to SIB fees. The CreateChildAccount transaction allows exchanges to create additional user accounts that enjoy the same benefits of that exchange’s master account.
MARKET MAKER ADDRESS - TYPE 'NDM'
Addresses used by the Endowment to receive newly-released ndau and issue them for sale at the current Target Price. Issuer addresses cannot be delegated or locked and are not subject to SIB fees.
BLOCKCHAIN POLICY COUNCIL ADDRESS – TYPE ‘NDB’
The Blockchain Policy Council (BPC) governs the ndau ecosystem. One aspect of that governance is the management of monetary policy through rate tables and other ndau system variables. This prefix identifies accounts controlled by the BPC.
KEYPAIRS AND SIGNATURES
A ndau public/private keypair is used to generate signatures for transactions and other data. ndau uses ed25519 elliptic-curve cryptography (https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ed25519-20110926.pdf) and secp256k1 HD wallet addresses (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1). ndau's BIP-44 registered coin type (at Satoshi Labs) is 20036 (0x80004e44): https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md 
NDAU ISSUANCE, TARGET PRICE, AND FLOOR PRICE
The ndau Endowment's role in monetary policy is to manage currency supply based on demand as indicated by the current Market Price. If the Market Price rises too high new ndau are issued from the Endowment, and if it falls too far the Endowment repurchases ndau and permanently removes them from circulation. The ndau Market Maker is authorized by the Endowment to take these actions.
TARGET PRICE
The Endowment can issue up to 30,000,000 ndau in three phases of 10,000,000 ndau each. The Endowment always offers to issue new ndau at a published, constantly-increasing Target Price based on the number of ndau already issued. The Target Price is initially USD $1 and increases every block of 1,000 ndau issued: each phase, therefore, consists of 10,000 blocks. During the first 10,000,000-ndau phase the Target Price doubles uniformly 14 times from USD $1 to USD $16,384 along an exponential curve. Numbering the first block of 1,000 ndau as Block Number 0, the Target Price for each Block Number in Phase 1 is:
 

FLOOR PRICE
The Endowment will always repurchase ndau at a published Floor Price. The Floor Price is calculated as 50% of the Endowment's current value divided by the number of ndau currently in circulation. The Floor Price can always be determined by any ndau holder but it is constantly changing due to the changing values of the two factors that determine it.
 

ndau purchased by the Endowment at the Floor Price are permanently removed from circulation. They are not added back to the total 30,000,000 ndau the Endowment may issue.
TRANSFERRING NDAU
TRANSFERS
ndau can be transferred from one account to another account, subject to certain fees and restrictions. Transfers specify a source account, a destination account, and the quantity of ndau to be transferred. The source account may not be locked: the destination account may be unlocked or locked, but if it is locked it may not be in its unlock countdown period.
ACCOUNT BALANCES, EAI, AND RECOURSE PERIODS
At any time an account has an available balance of ndau, and that available balance can be transferred to another account or used to pay transaction fees.
Accounts accrue EAI and it is periodically credited to them, but it is not included in an account's available balance until it has been credited to it.
All transfers of ndau are subject to the source account's recourse period, during which the amount of the transfer is not included in the destination account's available balance. All newly-created ndau accounts are assigned a default recourse period established by the BPC. The account owner can change the length of that period, including setting it to zero, at any time. The new recourse period does not become effective until after the length of the current recourse period has elapsed. Transfers to authorized exchange accounts are not subject to the sending account’s recourse period.
ndau transferred into an account is immediately included in that account's balance (and deducted from the source account's balance) at the time of the transfer for the purpose of calculating the account's weighted average age and EAI accrual rate. As each transfer reaches the end of its recourse period it is added to the destination account's available balance. ndau in pending but unsettled transfers cannot be transferred or used to pay fees.
STABILIZATION INCENTIVE BURN
The Stabilization Incentive Burn (SIB) is a mechanism to stabilize and support the market price of ndau. When in effect it is imposed as an additional fee when ndau are transferred from one account to another. Based on observed transactions, a current Market Price is regularly published to the ndau network. If the Market Price of ndau drops below 95% of the current Target Price, the SIB fee is imposed on all transfers. If the Market Price is 95% of the Target Price, the SIB fee is 0%. It increases linearly until it reaches 50% if the Market Price equals the Floor Price. To reduce the supply of ndau and support the Market Price, ndau paid as SIB fees are removed permanently from circulation ("burned").
 


TRANSACTION FEES
All transactions require transaction fees based on the transaction type, the size of the transaction in bytes, and the number of ndau involved. A table of transaction fees is published by the BPC specifying each of these parameters for each transaction type. The source account for a transfer must have an available balance greater than or equal to the sum of the amount to be transferred, the transaction fee, and the SIB fee if it is in effect.
 
ECOSYSTEM ALIGNMENT INCENTIVE AND LOCKING
ndau accounts can, after meeting certain requirements, earn Ecosystem Alignment Incentive (EAI) payments. EAI payments are newly-created ndau not released from the Endowment, and they are paid directly to the account.
EAI accrues over time based on the balance in an ndau account. It is periodically credited to the account and is not available in that account’s balance until it is credited. EAI always accrues at continuously-compounded rates based on the current EAI rate tables published by the BPC. These rates may change from time to time, and those EAI rate changes take effect immediately.
EAI accrues at a rate based on the amount of time ndau has been held in an account. Since at any moment an account’s current balance is the result of all the transactions that affected it since it was first created, its effective EAI rate is calculated based on an account’s weighted average age. The weighted average age is the sum of each amount transferred into the account multiplied by the age of that transfer, divided by the total number of ndau in the account. Transfers of ndau out of the account do not affect it since they are assumed to be an average-aged sample of the account balance. EAI credits do not affect the weighted average age if they are credited to the account accruing them.
LOCKING
Accounts may be locked, and they earn an increased EAI rate for doing so based on bonus rate tables set by the BPC. No ndau may be transferred out of an account while it is locked, but transfers and other payments may be made into it and EAI credited to it. When an account is locked, a notice period is specified: that notice period and the locked EAI rate bonus for that period are recorded. When an account is locked it receives the then-current locking bonus rate: changes to those bonus rates affect all subsequent locked accounts but accounts already locked retain their original bonus rates.
An account owner gives notice when they want a locked account to be unlocked. A countdown period equal to the notice period specified when the account was locked then begins. EAI is still credited to the account during its countdown period, but no transfers may be made into it.
While an account is locked, the length of the notice period is added to the account’s weighted average age for the purpose of calculating its current effective unlocked EAI rate. If notice is given to unlock the account, then during the notice period the elapsed notice period time is subtracted from that total. The account’s locked EAI rate bonus is then added to that unlocked EAI rate to determine the final EAI rate to be used.
A locked account may be re-locked at any time. The new lock period must either be longer than the current lock period or, if notice has been given to unlock the account, longer than the remaining notice period. The account is treated as if it had been immediately unlocked then locked with the new notice period.
CREDITING EAI TO ACCOUNTS
EAI is credited to accounts by active nodes in the ndau consensus network. An account must explicitly delegate this responsibility to a specific node, and accounts that have not been delegated to a node do not earn EAI. The Blockchain Policy Council (BPC) may establish additional criteria an account must meet before its accrued EAI is credited.
When EAI is credited to an account, fees are deducted from it to support ndau ecosystem services. These fees are set by the BPC, but currently total 15% of EAI: 1% for market maker operations, 4% for software development, and 10% for node and network operations. Additional fees (up to 5%) may be imposed by the BPC and exchanged for tokens belonging to the same account but on parallel blockchains devoted to non-currency services.
An account may be redelegated to a different node at any time. Nodes are required to credit EAI at intervals no longer than a length specified by the BPC. The BPC also specifies a maximum interval over which EAI may accrue before being credited. If a node fails to credit an account’s accrued EAI over a longer period, the next time it is credited (by either the same node or a redelegated node) the accrued EAI will be calculated as if it were last credited at the maximum interval before the present.
DESTINATION ACCOUNT
An account’s accrued EAI is normally credited to it but it may be directed to a different destination account when it is locked or re-locked. EAI credits directed to a different account do affect that account's weighted average age in the same manner as transfers into that account. That destination account may be unlocked or locked, but if it is locked it may not currently be in its countdown period. The destination account may not itself be directing its EAI to a different account, nor can an account direct its EAI to a different account if it is itself already the destination of another account’s EAI. Directing EAI to an account imposes no additional constraints on it: if the destination account is unlocked it may be locked at any time, and if it is locked then notice can be given to begin its countdown period.
TRANSACTION VALIDATION RULES
VALIDATION RULES
ndau accounts are protected by security mechanisms more powerful and more flexible than those offered by other digital currencies. Transactions may be required to meet multiple criteria before being accepted as valid, such as having multiple signatures, minimum or maximum amounts, or different signature rules for different transaction types.
Validation rules specify one or more validation keys and an optional validation script. Those keys and validation script are used to validate any transactions submitted for that account. Validation scripts have access to the current transaction, account state, and system variables but may not modify them. They may not generate new transactions or trigger external events of any sort: they perform no function other than to determine the validity of a transaction submitted for an account. Since all system variables and properties of the account and transaction are available to the validation script, it may establish validation rules for specific transaction types or rules based on specific values in the transaction or account.
When an account is claimed the initial set of validation rules is specified. After an account has been claimed it always has one or more validation keys assigned to it and may or may not have a validation script. All subsequent transactions submitted must be signed with one or more of the validation keys currently assigned to the account. They must also be authorized as valid by the current validation script if one is present. If there is no validation script assigned, then the transaction’s signature alone is sufficient to validate it. If a validation script is present, the transaction signature only indicates that the transaction was properly formatted and was submitted by at least one valid signer. Transactions may have multiple signatures, but all signatures must appear in that account's current list of validation keys.
When validation rules are assigned to an account, the validation script is checked for format an syntax. Each validation script indicates the minimum number of validation keys it requires, at at least that number of keys must be provided. A validation script may later be removed from an account's validation rules, but there must always be at least one validation key present.
Only then will the validation script be run. The validation script then determines the validity of the transaction: the transaction signatures alone may not be sufficient.
CHANGING VALIDATION RULES AND KEYS
An account's initial validation rules are established when the address is claimed: those rules may be changed later. Either the set of keys or the validation script, or both, may be changed at one time. Just as with any other transaction, an attempt to change an account's validation rules is also validated by the current rules. An account holder can, therefore, establish validation rules that prevent any further changes to those rules.
There are restrictions on these changes to prevent inappropriate uses, such as changing keys to effect a transfer of a locked account. An account change of control is the changing of more than 50% of an account’s validation keys within a specified period of time (a BPC-set system variable). If a change to an account’s validation rules and keys results in a change of control, that change is treated as if it were an attempt to transfer the entire balance of the account to itself.
•	If the account is unlocked the key change is permitted. The account’s weighted average age (for EAI calculations) is set to 0, and a SIB fee (if one is in effect) is charged based on the entire balance of the account.
•	If the account is locked the key change is not permitted.
Validation scripts are written in ndau's unique stack-based scripting language, Chaincode. Details are available in the Chaincode Technical Reference.
STAKING
Staking is the act of putting some quantity of ndau at risk to ensure good faith actions on the part of the staker. It is essentially a performance bond: if the staker fails to take some particular action, or acts contrary to their stated intent, the staked ndau may be forfeited (“slashed”).
Staking is always associated with an action or event. Stake is required to run an active ndau network node and receive node rewards. It is required to serve as an elected BPC member, raise a dispute over an ndau transaction, or for other purposes.
Staked ndau may not be transferred, since they must remain available to be slashed. Each staking action may require a minimum amount of stake and a minimum lock period.
When an account submits a transaction requiring stake, the staking rules are checked to determine whether stake has been properly created.. In order for the transaction to be valid, the account must already be staked with the minimum balance required. An account may be staked for more than one purpose at a time, and multiple amounts from one account may be staked for the same purpose.
Each transaction requiring stake has a corresponding transaction releasing it. The RegisterNode transaction registers an active ndau network node, the account submitting it must already have staked sufficient ndau for that purpose. When an UnregisterNode transaction is submitted to remove that node from active status, all staked amounts are unstaked.
Other ndau accounts may contribute to an account’s stake through the Stake transaction. This transaction specifies another account that is already staked for some purpose. The staked account is also staked for the same purpose and under the same criteria, and it is also subject to slashing. This additional staking provides some benefit to the original account, and they can expect to receive some share in that benefit or other reward as a result. Since total stake is a major factor in determining the amount of node rewards an active node may receive, additional stakers will increase a node’s ability to receive those rewards. In exchange, that node may be expected to share a portion of those rewards with those stakers. Since an account may only be staked for one purpose at a time, the Stake transaction commits additional stake for that same purpose. A staked account can be unstaked with the Unstake transaction.
