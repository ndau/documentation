**Addresses**
An ndau address is a string of 48 letters and numbers, and is generated according to a specified algorithm from a securely-generated public/private keypair known as its ownership key. ndau addresses are designed to be trivially recognizable as ndau addresses and to be easily checked for valid format. To avoid confusion, ndau addresses are all lowercase, contain no accented characters, and do not contain the characters O, o, 0, L, l, or 1. A checksum character is included to reduce the risk of typographic errors in the specification of an address.

**Address Types**
User (normal) Address - code 'A'
This is an address for normal holding and transfer of ndau. It has no special properties.

ndau operations address - code 'N'
All addresses owned and operated by ndev (for node operations, etc.) will use an N code.

Endowment address - code 'E'
Addresses generated by and for the endowment (sales of ndau) will use the E code.

Exchange address - code 'X'
Addresses designated for use by exchanges (and with special rules for EAI) will use an X code.

**Accounts**
An account is a single repository of value on the ndau blockchain. An ndau holder may have many ndau accounts, managed together in an ndau wallet application.
An account has a single balance and a single address that never changes. All ndau held in an account are indistinguishable: no transaction can specify which ndau in an account are to be affected by it, as there is no reason to do so. Unlike other digital currencies, ndau accounts have additional attributes other than their balances, so the words ‘account’ and ‘address’ are not synonyms. Every account has exactly one address, and every address is associated with exactly one account.
An account is created when a new valid ndau address is specified as the target of a transfer transaction or as the recipient of ndau newly released from the Endowment. Accounts are always identified by their addresses in ndau transactions. 
Any number of transfers may be made into a newly-created account. No transfers may be made out of that account, nor any other operations performed on it, until a valid set of signing keys has been assigned to it. Those signing keys (and any optional rules governing their use) control all further transactions on the account. No transaction may occur unless it is properly signed with one or more of the currently-valid keys assigned to the account.

**Transaction Fees**
Every transaction is charged a transaction fee, paid by the sender in addition to the amount being transferred. Transaction fees are calculated based on published rates. An address must have a sufficient balance to pay for the transfer fee and the amount being transferred. Accrued but uncredited EAI is not available for the transaction, nor are any incoming transfers whose settlement periods have not expired.

**Ecosystem Alignment Incentive**
An Ecosystem Alignment Incentive (EAI) is provided to encourage ndau holders to maintain their accounts over time and to encourage them to participate in the support of the entire ndau ecosystem. EAI comprises newly-created ndau (not released from the Endowment) that may be credited to a holder’s account in exchange for the holder’s ecosystem activities.
The ndau consensus network is built on a set of reliable, high-performance, censorship-resistant validator nodes. ndau holders help identify such nodes by observing their histories and selecting those to which they delegate their ndau accounts. Accounts retain their balances but do not accrue EAI until they have been delegated to a node, and that node is exclusively responsible for crediting that accrued EAI to its delegated accounts. Should a node fail to make those credits in a timely fashion, the holder will lose that accrued EAI and it may not be reclaimed. This potential penalty encourages the holder to study the set of available nodes, select high-quality ones, and monitor their ongoing performance. There are system-wide limits set on the frequency and amount of EAI credits: a minimum amount must accrue before it is credited, and credits may not be issued too frequently. Additional limits and requirements may be placed on EAI credit transactions by the BPC. Should its delegated node fail to provide satisfactory performance, an ndau account may be redelegated to a different node at any time.
EAI is accrued based on the weighted average age (WAA) of the balance in an account. Each time an account is the target of a transfer transaction, its weighted average age is updated:
current WAA=WAA at last inbound transfer+elapsed time

new WAA=  (current WAA ∙ current balance)/(current balance+transferred amount)

Outgoing transfers do not affect the WAA of the source account, nor do any EAI credit transactions. EAI is accrued according to a rate schedule published by the BPC, and the rate at which EAI is accrued by an account is based on its WAA.
An account’s EAI may optionally be credited to a different account. That target account may be accruing EAI at a different rate than the source account or have other properties that make it a preferred destination for EAI. An account’s EAI may not be sent to an account that is itself already sending its EAI to a different account.

**Locking**
To encourage long-term stability, ndau accounts may also accrue an EAI incentive if they are locked by the holder to prohibit withdrawals for a specified notice period. A locked account earns a lock incentive based on the notice period specified: longer periods provide larger lock incentives: the lock incentive rate schedule is published by the BPC. The current maximum lock incentive is obtained when an account is locked with a three-year notice period.
When an account is locked, the holder specifies a notice period and, optionally, a second account address to which its accrued EAI is to be credited. This alternate address may be unlocked, allowing credited EAI to be transferred while the original account balance remains locked. [[[ EAI may not be c
While transfers in to a locked account are permitted, no ndau may be transferred out of it. When the holder intends to unlock an account, they give notice of that intent. The account’s specified notice period begins, and no further incoming transfers are permitted although accrued EAI is still credited to it. When the notice period expires the account is unlocked, and outgoing transfers are again permitted.
When an account is locked, its WAA is immediately increased by the length of the unlock notice period. Its WAA continues to be updated at each incoming transfer until notice is given that the holder wishes to unlock the account. Its WAA is then frozen until the notice period ends, at which time the account is unlocked and its WAA resumes increasing.
A locked account may be relocked at any time, and the account to which its accrued EAI is credited may optionally be changed when it is relocked. If no unlock notice has yet been given, the new notice period must be longer than the current notice period. The account’s WAA is immediately reduced by the length of the current lock period and increased by the length of the new notice period. If unlock notice has been given, the new notice period must be longer than the time remaining before the current notice period ends. Its WAA is reduced by the remaining length of the current notice period and increased by the length of the new notice period. Relocking an account cancels any current unlock notice: the account will not be unlocked until the holder gives notice again and the new notice period expires.

**Settlement Period**
The ndau settlement period discourages the use of ndau for fraud or ransomware and can support a future dispute resolution mechanism for unauthorized transfers. This settlement period may be especially valuable to exchanges, as they are both likely targets for fraudulent outgoing transfers and likely to detect them within a short settlement period.
Transfer transactions are subject to the source account’s settlement period, during which time the transfer amount is not available to either the source or the target account. When an ndau account is created its settlement period is set to a default specified by the BPC. All newly-created accounts have a default settlement period specified by the BPC. An account holder may change an account’s settlement period to any value from 0 up to a BPC-defined limit, but the current settlement period must elapse before such a change takes effect.
Transfer transactions are immediately added to the target account’s balance. That account’s weighted average age is updated, and it continues to accrue EAI based on that new balance and weighted average age and have that EAI credited. The transferred amount, however, is added to the target account’s list of unsettled transfers. The total amount of an account’s unsettled transfers at any time is unavailable and may not be transferred out from it. Whenever a transfer transaction is initiated from an account the list of unsettled transfers is first checked and any transfers due to settle are removed from it and the total updated, increasing the account’s transferrable balance.
EAI accrues on a transfer during the settlement period at the rate that would have been effective if the amount had already been received in the target account, and it is credited to the target account under the same rules as settled transfers.

**Validation Scripts**
ndau accounts are protected by security mechanisms more powerful and more flexible than those offered by other digital currencies. Account transactions may be required to meet multiple criteria before being accepted as valid, such as having multiple signatures, minimum or maximum amounts, or a minimum time since the last transaction. Each ndau account must have at least one validation key associated with it, and it may also have a validation script assigned. Those keys and validation script are used to validate any subsequent transactions submitted for that account.
An ndau account has an address that is generated from a key known as the ownership key. A newly-created account can be the target of transfer transactions from other sources (including EAI) and can receive ndau newly released from the Endowment. No validation keys are associated with it and no other transactions are valid until a Set Validation Script and Keys transaction is submitted for the account. That transaction assigns one or more validation keys and an optional validation script to it. Once those keys and script are assigned, all subsequent transactions are checked against them and are only valid if authorized by them. Validation keys may be changed later, but at least one validation key must thereafter always remain associated with the account.
The first Set Validation Script and Keys transaction for an account must be signed with that account’s ownership key. All subsequent transactions must be signed with one or more of the validation keys currently assigned to the account and must be authorized as valid by the current validation script if one is present. If there is no validation script assigned, then the transaction’s signatures alone are sufficient to validate it. If a validation script is present, the transaction signatures only indicate that the transaction was properly formatted and was submitted by at least one valid signer. Only then will the validation script be run. The validation script then determines the validity of the transaction: the transaction signatures alone may not be sufficient.
Each validation script indicates the minimum number of keys it requires. For example, a script implementing two-of-three key validation will require three keys be specified for it in a Set Validation Script and Keys transaction. Either the set of keys or the validation script may be omitted from that transaction. If no keys are specified, the current set of keys remains unchanged. If no validation script is specified, the current validation script remains unchanged: to remove a validation script if one has been assigned it must be replaced with a trivial script that permits all transactions signed with one of the current set of keys.
The validation script is checked for proper formatting and syntax when it is being set, and the Set Validation Script and Keys transaction is not valid if the script contains syntax errors. Validation scripts have access to the current transaction, account state, and system variables but may not modify them. They may not generate new transactions or trigger external events of any sort: they perform no function other than to determine the validity of a transaction submitted for an account.
A validation script returns the value valid to indicate that a transaction has passed its validation tests. Any other return value, or any runtime error in the script, will cause the transaction to be invalid.
Since all system variables and properties of the account and transaction are available to the script, scripts may establish validation rules for specific transaction types or based on specific values in the transaction or account. Validation rules may be imposed on the Set Validation Script and Keys transaction itself: such rules could require two of three signatures to change the account’s validation keys, or they could make an account’s script immutable by preventing any future Set Validation Script and Keys transactions from changing it.
