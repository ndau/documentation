Technical and developer documentation

This repo holds the Sphinx sources for building documentation on http://readthedocs.com - we'll move to the public http://readthedocs.io when we no longer need to link to private repos.

Sphinx and readthedocs provide great integration for automatically rebuilding docs from other repos on commits, etc., so this documentation can both reside in one place and remain up to date.
