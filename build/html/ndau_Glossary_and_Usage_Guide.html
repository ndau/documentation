<p><strong>Acronyms</strong> – Spell out phrases the first time they are used in a document, followed by their acronyms in parentheses. Use the acronym thereafter in the document. The phrase may be spelled out again, followed by the acronym in parentheses, where it might be confusing. This may occur in long documents in which the reader may not read from the beginning (e.g. reference manuals).</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Safe</strong> - <em>for internal use only</em> - a system that allows the wallet to store encrypted data on the phone that can be decrypted with multiple combinations (e.g., recovery phrase or app password)</p>
<p><strong>Epistemology System</strong> - The Epistemology System attempts to provide some stable form of “truth” in that it produces a set of values on a periodic heartbeat, based on interpretation of market observations.  It is through this epistemology system that the ndau blockchain obtains accurate market price data.  <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=946935896432498339896485&amp;h2=Epistemology-Chain">More info</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chaos Chain</strong> - ****The Chaos Chain stores collections of keys and values that represent information of interest to the ndau system, timestamped on a blockchain. <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=946935896432498339896485&amp;h2=Epistemology-Chain">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Order Chain</strong> - ****The Order Chain contains a record of specific values used by the ndau Chain, timestamped on a blockchain. <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=946935896432498339896485&amp;h2=Epistemology-Chain">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ndau Chain</strong> - ****The main ndau blockchain. <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=946935896432498339896485&amp;h2=Epistemology-Chain">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong> - A program that reads information from the Chaos Chain and records the results periodically on the Order Chain. <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=946935896432498339896485&amp;h2=Epistemology-Chain">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chaincode -</strong> Chaincode is a system that allows users of ndau to express relatively complex logic about how their ndau should behave. <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Kents-notes-on--AMQKo_qLdAgCG_8FaGxgcLQuAg-wTqUaZouK2vuE5WYu2XV4#:uid=632922986672383840263750&amp;h2=Chaincode">More info here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ndau</strong> – A single unit of currency. Always spelled with a lowercase ‘n’, including when it is the first word in a sentence. Pronounced as “EN-dow”. ndau is a count noun, not a mass noun: “many ndau”, not “a lot of ndau”, and “fewer ndau”, not “less ndau”. Use the indefinite article ‘an’: “an ndau account”.</p>
<p><strong>napu</strong> - The smallest possible division of one ndau, equal to 1 x 10^-8 ndau. (Derived by flipping the word <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ndau</span></code> upside down.)</p>
<p><strong>Account</strong> – A single container of ndau. An account has many properties (e.g. lock status, weighted average age, etc.) in addition to its address. Do not use ‘address’ as a synonym for ‘account’: use ‘address’ only when referring to that specific attribute of an account.</p>
<p><strong>Address</strong> – A 48-character string identifying an account on the ndau blockchain. All ndau transactions identify an account by its address.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Terminology</strong> - Transfer transactions have a <strong>source</strong> and <strong>destination</strong> account. The source account <strong>sends</strong> ndau and the destination <strong>receives</strong> them. The affected ndau have been <strong>transferred.</strong> Transactions that only affect a single account (e.g. locking) act on that account as the object of the transaction verb: the holder <strong>locks</strong> an account, <strong>sets</strong> a Recourse Period, <strong>changes</strong> a validation script.</p>
<p><strong>Ecosystem Alignment Incentive (EAI)</strong> – (Not <em>Economic</em> Alignment Incentive) Newly-created ndau available to ndau holders to encourage holder behavior in support of ndau fiscal policy and goals.</p>
<p><strong>Locked</strong> – A locked account does not permit outgoing transfers. Locked accounts accrue additional EAI as an incentive for locking, and are subject to restrictions on when they become unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>Recourse Period</strong> – A period during which ndau transferred from a source account to a destination account are not yet available to destination account. Capitalize both words, do not use an acronym. Do not use ‘escrow’ as a synonym.</p>
<p><strong>Key</strong> – A private key and a public key together make up a <strong>keypair</strong>. Information (of any sort) can be combined with one of those two keys, creating a <strong>signature</strong>. The signature can be verified by a holder of the other key, and the information can be confirmed to be unmodified since it was signed. In most ndau (and other blockchain) contexts, information is signed with the private key and verified with the public key: therefore, it is usually not necessary to qualify ‘key’ as ‘private key’ or ‘public key’. Do not confuse ‘signature’ with ‘key’: a signature is created by the combination of information and a key.</p>
<p><strong>Signature</strong> - A combination of a <strong>key</strong> and information.</p>
<p><strong>Node</strong> - A computing device participating in the ndau network, running the ndau blockchain software.  Also referred to as “Network Node.”</p>
<p><strong>Node operator</strong> - An entity responsible for operating one or more nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Reward</strong> - A payment made in response to user behavior. Both EAI and node operations payments are rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Delegate</strong> - When an ndau holder assigns the calculation of EAI for a specific account to a specific network node.</p>
<p><strong>Stake</strong> - A quantity of ndau assigned to an ndau account to be used as a sort of surety bond for ndau node operations. “Stake” is also a verb describing the process of that assignment.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Stake</strong> - ndau from a source account that are staked to a rules account. ndau staked to a Primary Stake account is “<strong>co-stake</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong>Active node</strong> - An active node is a node that has self-staked a minimum quantity of ndau (as set by the BPC).</p>
<p><strong>Resiliency score</strong> - A measure of the quality of an active node’s performance in support of the ndau network. It is based on a node’s total stake, uptime/responsiveness, and other metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Validator node</strong> - An active node currently assigned to the ndau consensus engine’s validation network.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction fee</strong> - All transactions are charged a fee, deducted from the transaction’s source account. Fees are defined by a published fee schedule that is controlled by the BPC. In some cases, a fee’s value may be determined by a formula based on the fields in a transaction rather than being a scalar value.</p>
<p><strong>EAI Service Fees</strong> - Mandatory service fees deducted from all EAI: they include</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>An Ecosystem Funding Fee (4%)</p></li>
<li><p>A Market Maker Price Discovery Fee (1%)</p></li>
<li><p>A Node Operations Fee (10%)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>~~A 5% Side Chain Services Fee may also be imposed~~~~, which is converted into alternative tokens belonging to the same holder.~~</p>
<p><strong>Node operation rewards</strong> – Incentives for node operators to improve network performance and resilience. Rewards are paid from both transaction fees and from node operations fees deducted from EAI.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Phrase</strong> - A 12-word (could be more words in the future) ~~pass~~phrase that can be used to reconstruct the keypairs and addresses of all accounts in a wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet</strong> - A collection of account addresses and their associated private keys.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet</strong> ~~<strong>App</strong>~~ - The ndau mobile app, a <a class="reference external" href="https://ndaucollective.org/Knowledge-Base/the-ndau-wallet-how-address-generation-works-in-the-wallet">Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet</a> (HD Wallet) developed by ndev.   A wallet is a client software application used by an ndau holder to manage the collection of ndau accounts they own. ‘Wallet’ is also used to refer to that collection itself: both “I installed the ndau wallet” and “There are six accounts in my wallet” are correct. This is a very confusing term in the cryptocurrency world. It is sometimes also used to refer to the software required to run a node (sometimes that’s called a ‘full wallet’). Only use wallet in the two meanings given above. ndau blockchain transactions only operate on individual accounts: a wallet is a client-side convenience for users.</p>
<p><strong>App Password</strong> - The password a user enters whenever they want to open and use the Wallet App.</p>

<p>EAI is only credited to addresses delegating that action to active nodes. EAI accrues at rates based on a published schedule. EAI is accrued for each address but not credited to that address until its associated node explicitly requests it by submitting an EAI claim transaction. The BPC may specify additional requirements, to encourage ecosystem participation, before accrued EAI may be credited to an address.</p>
<p>ndau holder may lock an account for a specified period.  A notice period is specified when an account is locked. Its accrued EAI may be sent to a different account. The account holder gives notice when they wish the account to become unlocked. The account has then been notified and is in a notified state (not noticed) until it becomes unlocked.</p>
<p>Stake is required to make an ndau network node an active node eligible to receive node operation rewards. Failure to meet obligations imposed by that action can cause all or part of the stake to be forfeited. <em>[Stake here is only defined with respect to node operations. In the future, stake will be required for other activities such as dispute resolution.]</em></p>
<p>Any rewards for a node’s participation in the ndau network are credited to its address.</p>
